Often these digital services are direct replacements for legacy paper based services.</p>\n<p>This digital transformation provides organisations with the perfect opportunity to redesign these legacy forms making it quicker and simpler for users to achieve their goal. However, as well as opportunity, creating a digital experience can also introduce new problems, after all paper forms do have some advantages over their digital replacements.</p>\n<p>Benefits of paper forms:</p>\n<ul><li>They can be read from beginning to end allowing users to understand exactly what's expected of them before they begin</li>\n<li>They can be re-visited and/or part completed allowing users to gather information they may not have had to hand (without a complex save and return or password feature)</li>\n<li>They can be filled out in the order of the user's choosing</li>\n<li>They can be edited/checked before submission</li>\n</ul><p>For all of these reasons and more the structure and question sequence of online forms is hugely important.</p>\n<h2>Form structure</h2>\n<p>A well-thought-out form should flow naturally in the same way that a conversation would. Each new question put to the user should relate to the information they've already provided and progress in logical steps. The form should also flow from topic to topic, not jump sporadically from service choices to requests for user information.</p>\n<p>In most cases a form can be split into two topics:</p>\n<h4>1) The service - options relating to the service the user requires.</h4>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul><li>“When would you like your licence to start?”</li>\n<li>“Where will the activity tke place?”</li>\n<li>“What type of cover are you looking for?”</li>\n</ul><h4>2) The user - information about the user required either by the organisation or to identify available products.</h4>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul><li>“How can we send you your licence details?”</li>\n<li>“What is your date of birth?”</li>\n<li>“Do you have Blue Badge?”</li>\n</ul><h2>So, which should come first: the user or the service?</h2>\n<h3>1) Service first</h3>\n<p>In a well designed service the user and their needs should always come first, therefore the form should aim to focus on the user's' end goal. Any additional questions should come at the end.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cathydutton.co.uk/images/posts/designing-digital-conversations/service-first.jpg\" alt=\"Service first diagram\" />\n<p>There are many benefits to this approach, including:</p>\n<ul><li>Addressing the needs of the user before that of the service</li>\n<li>Opening the form with expected questions, making it quick and easy for experienced or return users to complete</li>\n<li>Creating a simplified journey by only asking the questions required for the selected product or service.</li>\n</ul><p>However there are also some drawbacks to opening the form with product related questions including:</p>\n<ul><li>We lose the opportunity to provide guidance for new or inexperienced users</li>\n<li>Users may be making ill-informed decisions</li>\n<li>Users could be presented with options they are not eligible for</li>\n</ul><blockquote>\"I don't know which option is right for me?\"</blockquote><h4>Example</h4>\n<p>Online booking forms are great examples of this service first approach with the user's end goal of booking an appointment being addressed first. Although the service will still need to collect the users details to complete the booking, these are only necessary if a suitable time slot is found, and so are placed at the end of the form.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cathydutton.co.uk/images/posts/designing-digital-conversations/online-booking.jpg\" alt=\"Online booking\" />\n<h3>2) User first</h3>\n<p>Sometimes the services or products available are determined by the user.
