Nintendo was founded on 23 September 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchiis and today is one of the world's largest video game and consumer electronics companies. Nintendo is known for creating some of the best-known and top-selling video game franchises, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Pok√©mon.

<h2 class="heading">My role</h2>
I worked as a senior UX developer on Nintendo's official UK store. A key aim for the online store is to "surprise and delight our customers at every opportunity"

Main responsibilities:

- Research and development on new features and site enhancements
- Creating code prototypes and demos for new, engaging features
- Front end development and testing across multiple browsers, platforms, and devices

<h3 class="heading">Bundle pages</h3>
In keeping with the company ethos I was part of the team tasked with delivering a new bundle product feature for the online store. The feature allows users to choose one item from each category to create their own bundle of products. I looked at possible ways to recreate the prototype interactions using SasS, CSS and JavaScript.
