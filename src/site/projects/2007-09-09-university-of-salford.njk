<p class="highlight-quote">Product designers are responsible for giving form, function and meaning to a range of products that furnish our everyday lives. Their creative and practical input provides the essential link between the consumer and the manufacturer. </p>

<p>I completed a degree in product design and development at the University of Salford in 2007. The course was made up of several modules including:</p>

- User research and persona development
- Sketch work
- Foam and card model making
- Computer modeling and animation
- Technical drawing
- Graphic design

<p>During my time at unaversity I was shortlisted for a <a href="http://www.pewterers.org.uk/pewter_live/pewterlive.html">Pewter live</a> design award with an adaptable <a href="http://www.pewterers.org.uk/pewter_live/Pewter_Live_2007_catalogue.pdf">candle holder concept</a>.</p>
