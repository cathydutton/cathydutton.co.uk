<h2 class="heading">My role</h2>
 I worked as a senior UX developer on the company's flagship brand MyProtein. I worked closely with both designers and researchers to improve the website usability and introduce new features. 

Main responsibilities:

- Writing production-ready, front-end code, testing and managing releases 
- Running a/b and multivariate tests to validate research and prove commercial worth.
- Carrying out code reviews and re-factoring legacy CSS
- Work in a multidisciplinary team to improve the user experience and site performance


<h3 class="heading">Breadcrumb</h3>

Breadcrumb links were added below the website header to aid users navigation around the site, and complex product categories. Tracking code was added to the links to help determine there usage and value.
