     large organisations including Defra, the Environment Agency, EE, Sainsburys and Barclays.

      Iâ€™m currently Head of Design for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) where 
      I spend the the majority of my time embedding user-centred design and building the capability of a 50+ group of Service and Interaction Designers.

      Defra works with 33 agencies and public bodies, during my 4 and half years here I have been able to use my experience and communication skills along with my 
      drive and determination to implement a user-centered approach to delivery in areas of the business with varying levels of both design and digital maturity.
