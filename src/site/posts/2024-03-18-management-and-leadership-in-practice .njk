<h2>Essay question</h2>

<p>
Write a 4000 word portfolio on the following topic...
</p>

<div class="highlight-text margin-bottom">	
  You are required to produce a portfolio which shows ongoing evidence of how you are applying learning on the PG Certificate in Management and Leadership to address your personal development goals. 
<p>
</p>
</div>



<h2>Personal development goals</h2>

<p>My ambition as a civil servant is to enable the effective and efficient delivery of public services. I am passionate about the role design can play in helping government to achieve this by collaborating across professions and organisational boundaries to solve wicked problems (Grint, 2010). 
</p>
<p>
After reviewing feedback, coaching sessions and discussions with my mentor and line manager I identified three development goals to help me achieve this ambition. Communicating confidently, increasing my visibility and impact, and knowing when and how to challenge decisions.
</p>
<p>
These goals will help strengthen my leadership capabilities and relate to my role which requires me to:
</p>

<ul class="unordered-list">
  <li class="unordered-list__list-item">
    Promote and sell the benefits of user centred design across the organisation and wider government.
  </li>
  <li class="unordered-list__list-item">
    Base
  </li>
  <li class="unordered-list__list-item">
    Collaborate with colleagues from a range of professions including Policy, Delivery and Strategy.
  </li>
  <li class="unordered-list__list-item">
    Make decisions quickly and confidently, adapting to changing circumstances by understanding when to be decisive, and when to be more flexible and collaborative in the decision-making process. 
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  By honing these leadership capabilities, I will be better equipped to navigate the complexities of wicked problems, promote collaboration, and drive effective solutions in the public sector. (Grint, 2010).
</p>



<h3>Goal 1: Communicating confidently</h3>

<p>I aim to enhance my confidence in addressing diverse and large audiences. While comfortable in smaller settings, I recognise the need to improve my confidence in speaking before larger audiences and different teams. This development is crucial for advancing service design, as my current communication style, influenced by nerves, may impede effectiveness (Barrett, 2006). My confidence limitations currently restrict my ability to share ideas broadly and actively participate in wider decision-making (DuFrene & Lehman, 2014).
</p>

<h4>SMART Objective: 
</h4>

<figure role="group" class="table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <caption>SMART Objective - goal one</caption>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="td-modal">Specific:</td>
      <td>I will enhance large group communication by speaking at portfolio and organisational events, seeking regular feedback.</td>
    </tr>
      <tr class="grey">
      <td class="td-modal">Measurable:</td>
      <td>Achieving this goal entails becoming more at ease in various communication settings and contexts. I'll gauge success based on received feedback and the successful completion of presentations, targeting one event per quarter to allow for continuous learning and improvement.</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <td class="td-modal">Achievable:</td>
      <td>To achieve this, I'll work with my manager to enhance communication skills (content, voice, and body language) and seek a mentor for consistent feedback and improvement.</td>
    </tr>
      <tr class="grey">
      <td class="td-modal">Realistic / Relevant:</td>
      <td>This goal might pose challenges as confidence isn't a static skill; however, I believe I can acquire techniques to project confidence. It's relevant because confident communication is crucial for leadership (Remund, 2014) and promoting awareness and acceptance of the service design profession.</td>
    </tr>

      <td class="td-modal">Timebound:</td>
      <td>By the end of the FLS course</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>

<h4>Rational:
</h4>

<p>Communicating confidently will ensure my message is clear and impactful (Burtis & Turman, 2009). This is key when dealing with complex problem spaces in my current role where I will need to convey decisions, ideas and outcomes (Allen, 2020).
Confident communication will also ensure I am perceived as both credible and knowledgeable by the people I communicate with (Barrett, 2006). This will help me to connect with a diverse set of stakeholders across the portfolio more effectively (Men et al., 2020). This will contribute significantly to my goal of bringing siloed teams together to facilitate collaborative problem solving and my ambition of growing the influence of the service design team.
  </p>


<h3>Goal 2: Visibility and impact
</h3>

<p>As part of my development, I aim to enhance my visibility and leadership beyond the design realm, spanning digital delivery and the broader organisation. This involves establishing connections throughout the department and collaborating to influence delivery outcomes. Currently, Service Design is perceived as somewhat isolated or an afterthought, limiting its value in the delivery process. To amplify impact, service designers must collaborate with Policy, Delivery, and Strategy teams, embedding design thinking and user insight into decision-making from project inception to delivery (Hamilton et al., 2011).
</p>

<h4>SMART Objective:

<h4>Rational:
</h4>

<p>Working across organisational boundaries is one of the most difficult activities to accomplish (Huxham & Vangen, 2003) yet is critical for solving the complex problems faced by Government organisations (Costumato, 2021; Hamilton et al., 2011). By increasing my visibility and impact across the portfolio I work in I will ensure that my contributions and expertise are recognised by a wider audience, building the trust needed to create an environment for cross-disciplinary collaboration (Broussine & Miller, 2005).
  </p>

<h3>Goal 3: Knowing when and how to challenge decisions
</h3>

<p>I am an inherently collaborative leader, consistently leveraging diverse knowledge and skills to enhance decision-making processes (Un & Cuervo-Cazurra, 2004). Nevertheless, there are instances where I've been encouraged to exhibit more assertiveness, especially when acting as the design expert in engagements with third-party suppliers or within areas of Defra characterised by low digital maturity. My objective is to discern when to adopt a decisive approach and when to embrace flexibility and collaboration in decision-making, ultimately supporting my team more effectively. Additionally, I aim to heighten self-awareness regarding my leadership shadow (de Haan & Copeland, 2015).
</p>

<h4>SMART Objective:

      <td class="td-modal">Timebound:</td>
      <td>By the end of the FLS course</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>

<h4>Rational:
</h4>

<p>My goal of making better decisions holds paramount importance in my current role where, as design lead, my focus is to maintain a collaborative and inclusive leadership style, guided by the principles of effective decision-making emphasised by Amason et al. (1995). Yet, there are instances demanding decisiveness, especially when providing direction to teams requiring more guidance, a concept supported by Turaga (2013). To optimise effectiveness, it is essential to navigate the balance between assertiveness and engagement, as outlined by Hoyt (2010).
Knowing when and how to challenge decisions also ensures a dynamic and adaptive approach to problem-solving, something that is key to building successful teams (Lilian, 2014) and solving complex problems (Hamilton et al., 2011).
  </p>


<h2>2. Diary entries</h2>

<h3>Diary Entry 1: Communicating confidently  
</h3>

<h4>What was the activity, what actions did you take and what competencies did you draw on during this activity? 
</h4>

<p>Together with my line manager, I explored several strategies to enhance my communication skills, aiming to cultivate a more confident style. This included finding a mentor, practising presenting at cross Government and private sector design events and requesting regular feedback.
The competency I wanted to develop was communicating confidently to large groups. Effective communication is a significant aspect of leadership (Kosiarek, 2016) and one which will become more important for me as I take on more responsibility and lead broader teams through change (Yukl & Lepsinger, 2006).

</p>

<h4> Evaluate your role within this activity. What could you have done differently or what explains your success? 
</h4>

<p>Engaging a mentor provided a crucial space for practising presentation techniques and receiving constructive feedback. While seeking feedback was valuable and reassuring, negative feedback in some instances impacted my confidence. 
Presenting a design-led approach to senior stakeholders at a team away day was a valuable exercise that pushed me out of my comfort zone. However, in hindsight, starting with a presentation unrelated to my daily work might have been more effective. The feedback I received was insightful, highlighting areas for improvement. Reviewing this feedback was a crucial yet challenging task. One key piece of feedback noted visible nervousness and struggles with eye contact. Despite initial disappointment, I learned that acknowledging vulnerabilities fosters a supportive environment (Ugaddan & Park, 2017)., encouraging others to express their public speaking fears.
In retrospect, I recognise the significance of seeking feedback despite the initial discomfort, as it fueled my growth in overcoming communication challenges. This is something I could have done much more off over the course of the year. I could also have spent more time accepting the challenges I face and finding a style that suits me as opposed to trying to learn to be like other people (Cain, 2012).
My confidence-building journey in communication has been mixed. Taking on more speaking tasks and presenting has increased my confidence, allowing me to develop nerve-calming techniques. I have learned that conveying confidence involves more than speech, and subsequent actions matter (Yukl & Lepsinger, 2006). My key learning has been that confidence is linked to knowledge (Barrett, 2006). In future, I will aim to speak on topics I understand and am passionate about to ensure a confident presence.

</p>


<h4> How does this activity relate to topics covered on the core learning modules?
</h4>

<p>The activities undertaken with my mentor closely aligned with the communication and voice lessons covered in module four. This experience provided me with the opportunity to delve into various vocal techniques, contributing to the refinement of my communication skills (VoicePrint, 2019). Participating in a recorded communication exercise offered valuable insights into the progress I had made and the notable development in my confidence over the preceding 8 months.
</p>


<h4> How has this activity contributed to your development goals?  
</h4>

<p>Throughout my career, enhancing my communication confidence has been a consistent theme. The FLS course and this activity aided me in building, rather than diminishing, my confidence. Guidance from my mentor created a supportive space for reflection, boosting self-awareness, and empowering me with coping strategies. Armed with these skills and techniques, I now approach presentations with increased composure, contributing to more effective communication. This is essential to my development goals of leading wider teams outside of the design profession where to be an effective leader I need to be perceived as both credible and confident (Barrett, 2006).
</p>



<h3>Diary Entry 2: Visibility and impact     
</h3>

<h4> What was the activity, what actions did you take and what competencies did you draw on during this activity? 
</h4>

<p>After discussions with my line manager and senior leaders in Defra, I identified strategies for improving the visibility and impact of the service design team. This involved working across team boundaries to amplify the impact and effectiveness of service design (Broussine & Miller, 2005). My first action was to set up and run a workshop with digital, infrastructure, operations and policy colleges giving everyone a shared understanding of the  service, any gaps, assumptions or duplications of effort.
The capability I wanted to develop was cross-functional collaboration, a key aspect of solving complex social problems (Broussine & Miller, 2005) and key for taking advantage of different experiences and expertise (Hamilton et al., 2011). This was important to my role as it would help to get the design team involved further upstream, able to influence decision making instead of designing already defined solutions (Stompff et al., 2016).  
</p>

<h4> Evaluate your role within this activity. What could you have done differently or what explains your success? 
</h4>

<p>I led a collaborative workshop with colleagues from Policy, Operations, Delivery, and Design, analysing a new policy's impact on key user journeys. The in-person session aimed to enhance communication and visibility of team activities (Hamilton et al., 2011). While the workshop was successful, some participants reverted to established methods afterward, hindering successful partnership working (Broussine & Miller, 2005). By bringing teams together to step through a piece of work I enabled all parties to get an insight into the work, constraints and challenges each team faces. This addresses one of the key barriers to successful teams and partnerships (Hamilton et al., 2011). However, providing a clear agenda beforehand could have mitigated tensions and misunderstandings.
For successful collaboration, parties must agree on shared objectives and responsibilities (Picciotto, 2004). To enhance the workshop's success, more upfront time with partners to agree on objectives and build trust is crucial (Cullen & Leavy, 2017). Further investment in understanding different team goals and motivations, incorporating active listening, is essential for creating a common purpose (Kosiarek, 2016).
The workshop was well attended but perhaps not well understood or valued by all parties this is because working across boundaries requires new paradigms, transformed cultures and supportive training (Getha-Taylor & Morse, 2013). Attendees may not have perceived collaboration as an achievable goal (Cullen & Leavy, 2017). Additionally, the lack of an agreed result or outcome led to insufficient commitment, aligning with Picciotto (2004) and Axelrod (2004), who emphasise the importance of mutual understanding for collaboration support. Despite challenges, I achieved success with three more workshops, increasing partner engagement and fostering a positive response to collaborative outputs (Huxham & Vangen, 2003). I also expanded the service designer team in the portfolio, enhancing our ability to collaborate with partners and take on more responsibilities.

</p>


<h4> How does this activity relate to topics covered on the core learning modules?
</h4>

<p>My activities closely aligned with module three, focusing on negotiation techniques and navigating the political environment. I applied these skills with peers and senior leaders to gain support for the workshops. Additionally, my understanding of the political landscape guided the selection of workshop topics to mitigate departmental risks.
Primarily, my efforts related to the Partnership Lifecycle, highlighting the significance of the scoping phase for a successful building phase (Partnership Accelerator, n.d.). This realisation was reinforced by Broussine and Miller (2005), emphasising the importance of pre-partnership work.

</p>


<h4> How has this activity contributed to your development goals?  
</h4>

<p>These initiatives initiated the breakdown of silos across the portfolio, allowing me to build relationships across leadership structures. A significant stride toward my goal of increasing impact within the organisation, these efforts led to the establishment of a pilot delivery team, bringing together Policy, Infrastructure, and Design to bring design thinking and user insight into the decision making process (Lim, 2018). 
</p>

<h3>Diary Entry 3: Knowing when and how to challenge decisions      
</h3>

<h4> What was the activity, what actions did you take and what competencies did you draw on during this activity? 
</h4>

<p>I explored and accepted opportunities to be involved in a range of meetings with different aims and expectations including being invited to more senior meetings with internal customers and suppliers. During these meetings I took a more assertive approach, making sure I got my point across and both influenced and made decisions. Doing this drew on a number of competencies including effective communication and influencing. The competency I wanted to develop most was decision making and selecting the right approach for each situation (Yukl & Mahsud, 2010).

</p>

<h4> Evaluate your role within this activity. What could you have done differently or what explains your success? 
</h4>

<p>Attending diverse meetings exposed me to varied communication techniques and perspectives, enhancing my understanding of organisational goals, constraints, and decision-making dynamics. However, practising assertiveness without adapting to meeting contexts limited the exercise's effectiveness (Barrett, 2006).
I took on a more assertive style and was more forward in the meetings I attended, however this wasn’t a style I felt comfortable with and as a result was not supported by the interactions and actions that followed. This inconsistency in future interactions had a negative impact on my attempts to set direction (Burtis & Turman, 2009).  Despite this, the increase in meetings I attended did enable me to quickly build my confidence and my ability to adapt to different audiences and situations. The exposure enabled me to switch my style more readily and increased my awareness of when to be direct, when to collaborate and when to listen  (Barrett, 2006).
On reflection I could have invested more time understanding the different personalities and politics at play before each meeting. I could have also set out a list of questions for myself before making a decision on how to act.
I could also have asked to observe or shadow meetings, making sure I was giving myself time to learn from how other leaders adapt and respond to different situations. This would have given me space to practise active listening and understanding, letting this inform how I respond (Covey, 2013).
My reluctance towards assertiveness stemmed from its negative connotations, particularly as Romero (2023) associates assertiveness with traditional, masculine leadership traits. This reluctance hindered my learning as I was unable to fully embrace the positive aspects of being assertive such as delivering clear and honest messages to enhance communication, understanding and kindness (Brown, 2018).
I also underestimated the role of self confidence in developing assertiveness (Brown, 2018). As my confidence is higher in situations I am familiar with, my success would be limited in meetings with new or more senior people.

</p>


<h4> How does this activity relate to topics covered on the core learning modules?
</h4>

<p>This activity aligns with module two, in particular difficult conversations and the 60 second conversation (Brown, 2018). It aided in delivering concise messages and understanding assertiveness nuances. It also resonates with module three, exploring negotiation and conflict resolution in assertive situations (Lencioni, 2002).
</p>


<h4> How has this activity contributed to your development goals?  
</h4>

<p>This experience supports my development goals by providing tools for a broader leadership role. It enhances decision-making, knowing when to be assertive or collaborative. Engaging in diverse meetings improves adaptability, sharpens communication styles, and boosts confidence in leadership abilities. Recognising the variety of approaches, as advised by Kilmann and Thomas (1978), instils confidence, aligning with Brown's (2018) principles for effective leadership.
</p>

<h3>Diary Entry 4: Visibility and impact  
</h3>

<h4> What was the activity, what actions did you take and what competencies did you draw on during this activity? 
</h4>

<p>I established a new project team to explore innovative approaches with Policy, Operations, and Infrastructure colleagues. Crafting a proposal, I presented it to senior leaders and identified a suitable project for the team. Communication of decisions to the wider program team and collaboration with key stakeholders were crucial aspects. The objective was to develop leadership capability, shifting from design responsibility to overseeing service delivery. Additionally, I focused on improving communication and influencing skills, acknowledging their significance in achieving successful project outcomes, as emphasised by Cullen and Leavy (2017) and Huxham and Vangen (2003).
</p>

<h4> Evaluate your role within this activity. What could you have done differently or what explains your success? 
</h4>

<p>Establishing a new team for collaborative user-centred work provided valuable insights into project lifecycles, navigating political pressures, and operating within resource constraints. Despite the benefits of starting on a smaller scale (Huxham and Vangen, 2003), the introduction of hybrid working methods led to increased conflict and confusion. The critical nature and political significance of the project also added pressure to deliver whilst implementing innovative approaches. In hindsight, opting for a less critical project might have allowed for a more gradual trust-building process (Axelrod, 2004).
Using communication and influencing skills, I gained approval from senior leaders, to pilot the approach. However I now recognise the necessity for more open communication with the wider team, especially in the forming stage (Tuckman, 1965). Implementing a clear communication plan to enhance coordination across reporting lines (Caldwell et al., 2017) and expanding communication to wider teams to address potential resistance earlier (Cullen & Leavy, 2017) were also identified as opportunities for improvement. I also now appreciate the potential for enhancing motivation through shared decision-making (Broussine & Miller, 2005; McNabb & Swenson, 2021).


Collaboration across team boundaries proved challenging due to differing goals, incentives, and management practices (Caldwell et al., 2017). The success in establishing a cross-team project was partly attributed to upfront work and preceding workshops that established shared problem spaces (Huang et al., 2018; Picciotto, 2004). Struggles arose from conflicting messages and contexts experienced by team members within different management hierarchies (Broussine & Miller, 2005), as noted by Cullen and Leavy (2017), who highlight a lack of a stable power or authority base for project leaders working across boundaries.

</p>


<h4> How does this activity relate to topics covered on the core learning modules?
</h4>

<p>This activity aligns with module two's core learning on team building and creating a success-oriented environment. Specifically, I applied Tuckman's Forming stage principles (Tuckman, 1965) to establish shared expectations and foster team cohesion. Learnings from Lencioni (2002) on preventing team failures, including lack of commitment, trust, and fear of conflict, were crucial during the team setup. Additionally, module three's insights from the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Model (Kilmann & Thomas, 1978) guided my interactions with stakeholders and team members, addressing diverse opinions and interests in team operations.
</p>


<h4> How has this activity contributed to your development goals?  
</h4>

<p>This activity significantly contributed to my overarching goal of enhancing the effective and efficient delivery of public services. Through increased responsibilities and collaboration with various teams and professions, I expanded my impact on project outcomes. It integrated learnings from all three development goals and the FLS course, enhancing both leadership skills and hands-on experience in steering collaborative efforts for efficient service delivery (Ansell & Gash, 2012). A key takeaway is the ongoing nature of this work; continuous maintenance and evolution of partnerships are vital for sustained visibility and impact (Partnership Accelerator, n.d.).
</p>



<h2>3. Core reflection</h2>

<p>Throughout the FLS Leadership Course, I have had the opportunity to develop my communication skills, enhance my decision-making abilities, and increase my visibility and impact across the portfolio team I work in. Each of these capabilities is vital to my ambition of contributing to the effective and efficient delivery of public services (DuFrene & Lehman, 2014).  The diary entries illustrate a consistent theme and a continuous journey toward increased confidence, leading to improvements in my communication skills, which directly influences not only my overarching ambition but also my other development goals of better decision-making and increased visibility and impact, thus enhancing my overall leadership capability (Kosiarek, 2016).
</p>


<p>Developing these capabilities has enhanced my ability to work collaboratively with a diverse range of stakeholders and to adapt to different contexts and challenges, an attribute which is key to working in large complex organisations (Costumato, 2021). My journey toward adaptability is evident throughout. Attending diverse meetings, learning when to adopt an assertive approach to decision-making, and recognising the need for adaptive communication styles. Challenges related to assertiveness, self-confidence, and upfront understanding of personalities and politics reveal the complexities of an adaptive leadership style (Yukl & Mahsud, 2010). Another recurring theme is the emphasis on collaboration across teams and functions. Efforts to improve visibility, conduct workshops with diverse teams, and establish cross-team projects highlight the challenges and complexities of sustained collaboration (Axelrod, 2004). 
</p>


<p>Throughout the FLS Leadership Course, the unifying thread weaving through all my development objectives has been the cultivation of self-confidence. My confidence journey during the course saw moments of heightened assurance juxtaposed with instances of feeling overwhelmed and out of depth, resulting in confidence fluctuations. This challenge became conspicuous during the voice sessions in module four and when feedback on my presentation style surfaced. The intricacies heightened during a transition to a new role and department towards the course's culmination. Achieving my goal of leading broader delivery teams introduced a new obstacle - the loss of accumulated departmental and project knowledge.
</p>

<p>Maintaining confidence amidst these uncharted territories was pivotal for my continuous development and the successful transition into a broader leadership role (Barrett, 2006; DuFrene & Lehman, 2014; Xenikou, 2022). An area that demanded immediate attention was conveying confidence when collaborating with projects and teams beyond my expertise. Acknowledging that mutual knowledge is a precondition for successful communication (Caldwell et al., 2017), I focused on my first development goal, presenting at events across and outside of government, to foster comfort in such situations. The FLS course also underscored the positive aspect of showing vulnerability and embracing struggles with confidence. Leaders willing to be vulnerable, as highlighted by Romero (2023), are more likely to build trust with their teams. In my new role, acknowledging vulnerabilities and actively seeking constructive feedback from senior leaders became instrumental in sustaining personal growth.
</p>

<p>The course provided a comprehensive understanding of confident and effective communication, dispelling the notion that charisma defines it (Cain, 2012; Kosiarek, 2016). The emphasis shifted towards connecting with people through meaningful conversations (Avolio & Gardner, 2005) and consistent actions reflecting conviction (Yukl & Lepsinger, 2006). Learning diverse methods of communicating confidently also involved adapting message content to connect with a wider audience. Despite differences in values, goals, and objectives, finding common ground with those I communicate with became essential (Men et al., 2020). This adaptation proved invaluable as I transitioned into a broader leadership role, allowing me to navigate confidently despite a lack of detailed knowledge and communicate the imperative of collaborative problem-solving for complex, cross-cutting issues. This resonates with Sinek's (2011) insight into engaging people more effectively by conveying the "why" rather than the "what" or "how."
</p>

<p>A key takeaway from the course was learning to stay true to myself while embracing adaptive leadership and incorporating course learnings. Effective communication, as emphasised by Kosiarek (2016), prioritises authenticity over content, a sentiment echoed by Ugaddan and Park (2017), who recognize authenticity as a key quality of successful leaders.
</p>

<p>The journey of strengthening self-confidence significantly transformed my self-perception and belief in achieving goals. This transformation played a decisive role in my decision to apply for a senior leadership role, marking a pivotal step in my ongoing leadership journey. As I navigate this new role, leveraging all learnings from the FLS course, particularly in maintaining a confident persona while becoming increasingly comfortable with a lack of detailed knowledge, becomes imperative.
