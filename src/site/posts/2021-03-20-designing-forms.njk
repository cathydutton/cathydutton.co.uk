<p>Form design working group</p>
<p>How can we re-design legacy forms?</p>

<p>Questions to answer:</p>

<p>1) What is the minimum viable amount of design you can apply to a form?</p>
<p>Going back to the original problem statements time and money are often blockers to designing better forms. If we have limited funding and/or time how do we still make space to design usable, accessible forms that are better than the existing ones?</p>

<p>2) When does a form become a digital service?</p>
<p>Can we create clear definitions of a form and a digital service?</p>

<p>3) How or should we meet the service standard?</p>
<p>If form design is different to delivering services do we need to meet the service standard?</p>

<p>4) Should we or can we use GOV.UK branding?</p>
<p>If we do not meet the service standard can we use the Gov.UK branding? If we dont are we losing the trust already built between Government services and users?</p>

<p>5) How do we upskill and/or share knowledge so design does not become a bottleneck?</p>
<p>Another original problem statement was around the need to design forms at scale, how can we make sure this is achievable?</p>
