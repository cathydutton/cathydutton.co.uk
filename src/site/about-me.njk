    <p>
      After completing a three year Fine Art course in 2004 I went on to gain a degree in Product Design and Development from the University of Salford in 2007. 
    </p>

     <p>
     Over the past 15 years, I have had some great opportunities to develop my skills and experience working on a range of projects for creative agencies, small businesses, global brands, and government departments, helping the teams I have worked with create user-focused, accessible, and intuitive services. 

    </p>

    <p>
      I’m currently Head of Design for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). In this role, I lead a community of 50 plus Interaction and Service designers across Defra supporting delivery teams, programmes, and portfolios to create inclusive services.
    </p>
    <p>
     My role includes mentoring designers of all abilities as well as setting the strategy for design and defining the standards we work to.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a trained Government service assessor and member of the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/design-system-working-group/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Design system working group" class="anchor">GDS design system working group</a>, helping to maintain standards whilst promoting inclusivity.
